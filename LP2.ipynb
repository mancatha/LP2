    "# Telecommunication Company Churn Analysis-Classification Model\n",
    "## 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "- Customer attrition is one of the biggest expenditures of any organization. Customer churn otherwise known as customer attrition or customer turnover is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service within a specified timeframe.\n",
    "For instance, if you began the year with 500 customers but later ended with 480 customers, the percentage of customers that left would be 4%. If we could figure out why a customer leaves and when they leave with reasonable accuracy, it would immensely help the organization to strategize their retention initiatives manifold.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this project, we aim to find the likelihood of a customer leaving the organization, the key indicators of churn as well as the retention strategies that can be implemented to avert this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Help the client, a telecommunication company, to understand their data.\n",
    "2. Find the lifetime value of each customer.\n",
    "3. Know what factors affect the rate at which customers stop using their network.\n",
    "4. Predict if a customer will churn or not."

    "## 5 Analystic Question \n",
    "\n",
    "1. How does gender impact customer churn? Are there significant differences in churn rates between male and female customers?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Does the presence of a partner or dependents influence customer churn? Is there a relationship between marital status and churn behavior?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How does the length of tenure affect churn rates? Are customers with longer tenures less likely to churn compared to new customers?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What role do additional services (e.g., online security, tech support, streaming TV, etc.) play in reducing customer churn? Are customers with more services less likely to churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Is there a correlation between the contract term (month-to-month, one year, two years) and churn rates? Are customers on long-term contracts less likely to churn compared to those on month-to-month contracts?"
